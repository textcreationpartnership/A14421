            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That day we tackt to and againe, vntill wee had recouered the point Eaſt of the Ile of <hi>Wight:</hi> And on the Thurſday wee ſtood on our way towards the Weſt, vntill wee were come almoſt to the height of <hi>Plimouth;</hi> and then about 8. of the clocke at night we ſtood off to the Sea Eaſt and by South, and vpon the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day wee did ſee a point of Land on our Larboard bowe in our iudgements 12. leagues off, called the <hi>Vſhing,</hi> in 47. degrees, or thereabout (a part of <hi>France.</hi>) Then we ſtood off to the Sea that day, and Saturday, and Sunday, and Monday: on Monday towards night we did ſee 14. ſayle of Ships a head of vs, which ſtood in toward vs about one houre,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1924:3"/> but by that time they had deſerued what we were, not liking to ſpeake with vs, they ſtood away to the Weſt before a winde: The Lord Admirall with 60 ſayle of ſhips ſtood after them, ſome 24. houres, but could not come vp to them, but did perceiue them to bee <hi>Dunkerks;</hi> and then againe ſtood on his way for his intended Port.</p>
                  <p>Hauing loſt the Lord <hi>Haruey</hi> in the <hi>Repulſe,</hi> with ſome 40. Saile of ſhips with him, which did not follow the Admiral at the firſt purſuit of <hi>Dunkerks,</hi> but ſtood ſtill to the Eaſt, and there they plyed to and againe for 8. dayes; So that the <hi>Admirall</hi> was come to Anchor neere the Eaſt end of the Ile of <hi>Ree</hi> on the Monday: and the Lord <hi>Haruey</hi> came thither on the Wedneſday, being the 10. of <hi>Iuly:</hi> but both had one part of one ſtorme.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Nonſuch</hi> of the Kings had ſpent her Fore maſt, and ſome of the ſhips that were with the <hi>Repulſe</hi> loſt their long Boates (being towed at their ſterne) but our happy meeting againe made our loſſe to ſeeme the leſſe. So we ſpent two nights and one day in Counſell, and determining what was to be done to our beſt aduantage; and ſo at laſt it was determined that the Souldiers ſhould be landed on thurſday at the Eaſt end of the Ile of <hi>Ree,</hi> which was done about 3. of the clocke in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noone, the <hi>Duke</hi> in perſon with the foremoſt,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1924:3"/> and cauſing them to recouer as much ground as they could on the ſide of the hill: Did take his Barge againe, accompanied with maſter <hi>Grimes</hi> Gentleman of the Horſe, and goes from one Shipp to another, to pray them to make all the haſt they could poſsible: but returning to the Land againe, he found them in ſuch a deſperate manner running into the Sea, to catch hold of any Boat to be gone, that they drowned themſelues and others: but tht Duke to appeaſe theſe Reuolters, ſtands in the head of the Barge, with his Sword drawne in his hand, praying ſome, and taxing otherſome with feare and cowardiſe, to returne to their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on the ſhore, which were in great danger: for had not Coronell <hi>Borowes</hi> and Coronell <hi>Brett</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtird themſelues like valient men, and keeping their Regiments from Routing, the Enemy had had the honour of the day to all likelyhood, (for neuer was ſeene ſo braue a Charge as this.</p>
                  <p>They did ſuffer vs to land ſome 2000. men, and then did the French Horſe in 3. troopes, ſome 200 or more and ſome 1200 foot ſo valiently charge into the middeſt of our Army vp to the ſaddle into the Sea, and ſo valiently behaued themſelues, that very few of the Horſe that came one did euer get of. If their Foot had bin as deſperate as their Horſe, without queſtion we had loſt the honour of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1924:4"/> firſt encounter: but God the diſpoſer of all things, ſtrooke the Enemy with ſuch feare, that they made as much haſt as they could to be gone, and left vs to land all our men, and order them in battell array: the which was done that day, and the next all our Forces both men and horſe were landed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good that Fort, we did not ſtirre from thence before Saturday night, and then aduancing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward not more then halfe a mile, wee reſted that night.</p>
                  <p>On the Sunday Morning we marched vp into the Iland at leaſt 3. miles to a towne called <hi>Allaflote</hi> where the Miniſter and ſome of the chiefe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of the towne came to our generall (the <hi>Duke</hi>) and did deliuer themſelues and Towne into his hands: praying him that he would bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable vnto the Papiſts, and not put them to the mercy of the Souldiers, for feare leaſt heareafter the day that was loſt might be recouered and ſo the Proteſtants ſhould be put all to the ſword, the which the <hi>Duke</hi> taking into conſideration did charge all the Soulders vpon paine of death, not to ſtirre from theire collors, ſo they reſted all that night in the field and the <hi>Duke</hi> did take part with them, lying in the head of Coronell <hi>Borowes</hi> Regiment on a canuas Horſe couered with two
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1924:4"/> cloakes, his followers lying on the ground about him:</p>
                  <p>The next day a councell was called, and it was agreed on, that we ſhould martch towards St. <hi>Martins</hi> on the Tuſeday morning, which was done; the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Mounſier Sebueſa,</hi> accompanied with ſome Lords and Knights did accompany the corps of Sir <hi>William Hayden</hi> to the Earth with much griefe, for the vnfortunat death of ſo worthy a man, hee was buried at <hi>Allaflota,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> returnes to lodge in the field, but that night it did ſo Lighten, Thunder, and Raigne, that I haue ſeldome ſeene the like.</p>
                  <p>On the Tewſday morning we marched on our apoyinted way although the morning was but little fairer then the night, but it pleaſed God that before twelue of the clock the ſunne did ſhew it ſelfe fauourable in drying our wet cloathing, the enemy did ſend out many ſcouts to looke vpon vs, but I thinke the longer they lookt on vs, the worſe they liked vs, for I thinke our Armie from Front to Reare did take vp at leaſt one Mile and halfe: Yet then did march out of their fort ſome troopes of Horſe, and ſome companies of foote and did make a ſhew as if they would giue vs a battaile, but bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aduiſing with themſelues they ſuffered vs to Martch vntill we had gained both Sun and Winde of them.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1924:5"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> did at that inſtant time ſo couragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly martch in the formoſt companies, that it did ſo animate the Souldiers, that I haue hard many of the Souldiers wiſh that the <hi>French</hi> would ſtand one Encounter, that they might ſhew theire loue vnto theire Generall (but that would not be at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,) after we had martched vp to the Eaſt ſide of the towne ſo farre as the Sea would giue vs leaue: we began to come nearer to the towne, our <hi>Drakes</hi> performing their parts on the Horſemen that came foorth to ſee vs, and killed one gentleman and two Horſes.</p>
                  <p>About fiue of the clocke at night, ſome of the chiefe men of the Towne came foorth with a flagge of truce, and did offer to deliuer themſelues and towne into the hands of our Generall: they being Proteſtans that were left, the <hi>Duke</hi> accepted of their offer, and ſo marching into the Towne, and quartring his Soldiers in ſeuerall parts of it, did ride vp to the Priſon houſe, to ſee if any Engliſh were there, but finding none he returned to the water ſide, where Collonell <hi>Borowes</hi> quarter was, ther did he ſee the malice of the enemie in burning of three good ſhip in the Harbour that had bin taken from the Engliſh: and then taking his barge, he went aboard the ſhips, commanding all them to ſend victuals a ſhore for his Souldiers, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:1924:5"/> that there was no want of any thing, although the Enemie had taken all their owne prouiſion, and the Proteſtants away with them into the Fort: and now doe they begin to batter night and day vpon the Towne with their Ordnance; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had battered from Tueſday vntill Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night, I could not heare of more then one man that was killed: although the Fort be within Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ſhot of the Towne, and the ſhot flying into all parts of the Towne as on Thurſday as the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Sabueſa</hi> were talking, there came two ſhot ſo neere them, that they were faine to goe to end their diſcourſe in ſome other place: It was appointed that on the Saturday twenty field-Peeces at leaſt &amp; nine Drakes ſhould be mounted againſt the Fort, with our Pyoners and our Souldiers to make ſome Trenching worke: but that I cannot ſpeake of, but will pray for a good ſucceſſe to their intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and ſo for <hi>England</hi> with the good Shippe of the Kings called the <hi>Charles,</hi> whom God preſerue.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Edneſday the 26. of Iune we ſet ſaile, but hauing the winde very contrary, we beate vp and downe the Sea vntill the ſecond of Iuly, when we diſcouered 14. Sailes of <hi>Dunkerkers,</hi> (as we afterwards vnderſtood;) My Lord Generall appointed ſome of his Shippes to chace them, who purſued them all night and next day, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them ſo cloſe as they were forced in the night to fling ouerboord ſome of their Ballaſt and their Stuffe, and to put foorth ſtudding Sailes, and goe right before the winde, hauing loſt ground vpon a tack and at veering, and ſo not without difficultie eſcaped vs.</p>
                  <p>From that day we beate vp and downe the Sea vntill the eight of Iuly, when the winde came good.</p>
                  <p>On wednedſday the tenth, we had a great tempeſt and verie thicke weather, and ſo obſcure, as being driuen by the winde neere the coaſt, and in the morning (not being able to make land) we ran a great hazard: But God be thanked, about noone the weather growing more cleere, we diſcouered the Ile of <hi>Retz,</hi> and the ſame day we entred into the <hi>Pertuy Breton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chaſe of the <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> did ſeperate the Squadron of the Reare Admirall from vs (together) with ſome other Shippes, ſo as my Lord Duke ſtaying for the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of the reſt of the Fleete, did nothing on teweſday at night, &amp; on wedneſday morning but compaſſe the Iland with his Veſſels, and ſtop all the entrances into the Iland.</p>
                  <p>On wedneſday at night arriued my Lord <hi>Heruey</hi> very happily with the Reareward, and next day at noone we landed.</p>
                  <p>After we had put on ſhore vpwards of one thouſand Foote, the Enemie (who had laine in certaine hollow groundes) began to appeare, with aboute 300. or 400.

The Infanterie came on in an other part, and gaue their firſt Fires as neere and with as much reſolution as was poſſible; But after they had taſted of our Pikes, they gaue quickly ouer, and ran away in the fouleſt diſorder that could be, and did not that day anſwere the opinion that all <hi>France</hi> hath of the Regiment of <hi>Champagne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lord Generall had ordered certaine Shippes to ſcoure the landing place with their Ordinance, but the aſſault was ſo ſodaine as they did little hurt to the Enemy; and in the very heate of the Combate, it fell out that one of our owne Shippes had engtangled himſelfe betweene our battering Shippes and the Land, by which meanes they were hindred in performing of their charge.</p>
                  <p>The Enemie loſt ſo manie Noblemen and Gentlemen of

                  <p>That night and the next day was ſpent on our ſide in retrenching &amp; in putting neceſſaries for our Soldiers on Land, and in landing of our Horſſe.</p>
                  <p>The Enemie ſent a Trumpet with the Barron of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleuille,</hi> to demande the Dead, who was receaued with ſuch curteſie, and the Dead rendred with ſuch Militarie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, as they confeſſe themſelues no leſſe vanquiſhed by my Lord Generalls Fauours, then by his Armes.</p>
                  <p>The 14. day a Councell was kept, and the reſt of the day was ſpent in vnſhipping of the Ordinance &amp; Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and preparing of eight Drakes to be drawne along with our Forces by Men for want of carriage: And at night the Armie was drawne into Battaile, and ſeuen Companies, with Colonell <hi>Bartu</hi> were left in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment.</p>
                  <p>On the 15. day, our Armie marched by fiue in the morning, and tooke in Saint <hi>Marie</hi> and <hi>la Flote,</hi> where they lodged that night: In which places my Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall left the Inhabitants in as great ſuerty and more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then they were before; the Soldiers taking nothing but what they paide for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mounſiere de Toyras</hi> had ſent a brauing complement that he would viſit him that day; for which, my Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall gaue the Bearer a good reward, but it prooued but a Complement.</p>
                  <p>The 16. his Grace repoſed the Armie, and buried the Bodie of Sir <hi>William Heydon,</hi> with all Militarie honour, himſelfe and <hi>M. de Seabiſe</hi> accompaning the Corpes.</p>
                  <p>On the 17. the Armie marched to Saint <hi>Martines,</hi> the principall Towne of the Iland, as great as <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where the Enemies Cauelerie did appeare againe, whome our Infanterie had ſo great a winde to be dealing with, as hardly the Officers could keepe them from ſetting on

                  <p>This euening our Armie lodged as peaceably in Saint <hi>Martines</hi> as if we had been in Voyage and not in Warre; the Inhabitants receauing vs with great cheerefulneſſe, embraſing <hi>M. de Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The ſame night hearing there were ſome Commaunders behinde in the Towne, who kept diſorder; he went a ſhore himſelfe, and ſearcht all the houſes in the Towne, where he found ſome Captaines that had been diſorderly: Amongſt the reſt there was one that gaue an vnmannerly anſwere, who was caſheered for his labour.</p>
                  <p>That night the Lord Generall lay a ſhore: the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betimes he went a board. On Wedneſday the 27. wee weighed Anchor with 100. ſayle of Ships, and tackt to and againe vntill wee recouered the Poynt Eaſt of the Ile of <hi>Wight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thurſday the 28. wee ſtoode on our courſe towards the Weſt, vntill we were come to the height of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> about eight of the clock at night: wee ſtoode Weſt, and Eaſt, and by South. And on Friday the 29. wee ſayled with a ſlacke winde; but before night wee got ſight of land on our Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, ſeeming to be 12. leagues off a part of <hi>France,</hi> called the <hi>Vſhant,</hi> in 47. degrees or there-abouts. Wee ſtoode on to Sea that night, with a freſh gayle of winde, which ſerued
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1924:11"/> vs vntill the next morning at two of the clocke, and then wee were becalmde till Monday the firſt of Iuly, at foure of the clocke. At which time we ſent a Boy to the top of the mayne Maſt, to ſee what he could diſcouer, he ſpied on the head of vs 14. ſayle of Shipps ſome foure leagues off, and very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately within a quarter of an houre after there aroſe a good gayle of winde fully with vs, ſo that the Admirall and all the reſt made haſt to hoyſt vp ſayle and chaſe theſe Ships. Before nine of the clocke at night a Catch of his Maieſties ouertook them, which was commanded by Captaine <hi>Dunning,</hi> he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them and asked what they were, they tolde him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary tale: he deſired then to winde about, and come aboard and ſpeake with our Admirall. They bid him goe before to their Admirall, and what he did they would follow: he came to their Admirall and deſired him to winde about and ſpeake with our Admirall. Their Admirall asked <hi>Dunning</hi> what Fleete it was, he tolde him it was the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Fleet, hee asked what they were doing there: hee tolde them they were Tacking to and againe to ſcoure the Seas. No (ſaith he) I know you are going to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> but there you will finde them prepared for you, and they will giue you hot ſeruice. Hee asked who was our Admirall, hee tolde them my Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Whereupon hee fell in rayling, and called vs all Roagues and Raſcalls, and commanded the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to ſhoote; he ſhot halfe a dozen ſhot at him, and ſhor him twice through the ſayle, hard by the middle of the mayne Maſt: ſo that <hi>Dunning</hi> fell a ſterne of him, and tackt about to vs, and tolde vs what had paſt, and that he conceiued them to be <hi>Dunkerks</hi> men of Warre, very well appointed, which did much comfort our Generall, and all the reſt. We chaſed them all night: and on Tueſday the 20. of Iuly at light day, wee had got neere vnto them with ſome of our Shipps. The <hi>Lyon</hi> had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ut in this time they were throwing out their Balleſt, and making themſelues light: and when they had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1924:11"/> done that, they hoyſed vp ſtudding Sailes, and after outſailed vs quite; We followed them ſo farre, as there was no hopes, and then wound about to our intended courſe: At foure of the clocke the ſame day, my Lord cauſed to ſend vppe to the maine Maſt, to tell how manie Shippes we were in company, and we found we were then no more then three ſcore; for we had loſt in that Chaſe my Lord <hi>Haruey,</hi> with fortie ſaile of Shippes, who met not with vs till wedneſday the 11. of Iuly.</p>
                  <p>We were kept from the place where we intended (with contrarie windes and calmes) till teweſday the 10. of Iuly; About two of the clocke, then fell a violent ſtorme, with a thicke miſt, ſo that we were put into great danger.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Noneſuch</hi> in this ſtorme had ſpent her Fore-maſt, and many of the other Shippes loſt their Long-boates, being ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Sterne. About eight of the clock the ſtorme broke vp, and it grew to bee cleare; Then we diſcerned the Iſle of <hi>Ree</hi> to be within three leagues of vs, whither we ſteered our courſe; And about ten of the clocke caſt anchor ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Saint <hi>Martines,</hi> the prime Towne in that Iſland. The Next morning being wedneſday, we weyed anchor, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe lower to a point of the Iſland next to the maine-Land, and ouer againſt <hi>Rochell.</hi> There we caſt anchor, and placed our Shippes round about the Iſland, that the Enemie might neither export nor import any thing for their aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>That done, being the 11. of Iuly, we had very good ſport in chaſing thoſe Barques and Hoyes which were offering to goe from the Iſland to the maine-Land, and from the maine-Land to the Iſland: We tooke many of them, and there were none that got eyther in or out. About ſixe of the clocke that day, my Lord <hi>Haruey</hi> appeares with his fortie ſaile of Ships, which was vnto vs a great comfort: About eight of the clocke the ſame day, the Lord Generall called a Councell, and reſolued to land our Men the next morning, vpon that point which lay iuſt to vs, as being the moſt ſafe place; At which time he gaue order to ſome Shippes to batter a Fort, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1924:12"/> lay a league off on the right hand, &amp; continued the battering till ten of the clocke the next day; then we found there was no reſiſtance in the Fort, whereupon, the Lord Generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to giue ouer.</p>
                  <p>On teweſday the 12. the L. Generall was vp and readie by three of the clock in the morning, and receiued the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion that morning at fiue of the clocke, and after tooke his Barge and went aboard the <hi>Nonſuch</hi> to Monſiure <hi>Subceſa,</hi> and returned from thence at ſixe: At ſeuen of the clocke, Monſiure <hi>Sabueſa,</hi> Monſiure <hi>Blancarte</hi> and Sir <hi>William Becher</hi> went to <hi>Rochell:</hi> At eight of the clocke, the L. Generall ſent Maſter <hi>Grymes</hi> (the Gentleman of his Horſe) with a Foote-boy of his that could both runne and ſwimme well, and ſixe Muskatieres (to the point of the Iſland, where they were to land their Men) to ſee if they could diſcouer any Men or Ordnance, that they had planted there to encounter vs: When he came to the ſhoare, he cauſed the Foote-boy to ſtrippe himſelfe, and to run along, and he run three quarters of a mile into the Countrey, and found all that Coaſt cleere, ſauing three Horſe-men, that the Enemies had ſet out to be Scoutes, which chaſed him back to the Sea ſide; The Boy was releiued by the Ship Ordnance and the Muskets in the Boate: At ten of the clocke, he turned back to the <hi>Triumph,</hi> and gaue the L. Generall an accompt what he had diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Whereupon, the L. Generall gaue preſent order for all Officers to be in a readineſſe, and to meete him aboard the Kings good Shippe (called the <hi>Lyon</hi>) lying next the Pointe, where they were to land their Men, for there he would keepe his Randeuous for that time: At twelue of the clocke, he tooke his Barge, accompanied with Sir <hi>George Blundell</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant Maior, attended by M. <hi>Grymes</hi> and M. <hi>Aſhburneham,</hi> and went to all thoſe Ships that had Land Soldiers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them that they ſhould preſently draw themſelues as neere that point of the Iſland as they could; After that, he went to all the Ships, and appointed the Captaines of them, how and where to attend with their Shippes, and commanded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1924:12"/> them preſently to prouide their Barges and long Boates, to land their Land Souldiers, and to ſend them to the Lyon. Hee then made choyſe of tenne Ships of leſſer burthen, and directed them to draw their Shipps as cloſe as they could to either ſide of the point of the Iſland, where the Souldiers were to be Landed, and commanded them that if the Enemie did appeare within ſhotte, they ſhould preſently play vpon them.</p>
                  <p>He being aboard at the ſame time of one of theſe Shippes, went vp to the top of the mayne Maſt, and diſcouered of the Enemies three Troupes of Horſe, and 16. or 18. hundred Foote, all ready in Battalia ſome Engliſh mile or more off the place, where wee were to land our men: hee came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently downe and tolde vs what hee had diſcouered, and ſhot at them himſelfe two or three Peeces of Ordnance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the reſt of the Peeces to play vpon them ſtill: with that tooke Barge and went to the Lyon, where hee found all the Officers ready with their long Boates to land their men.</p>
                  <p>In this time came backe from <hi>Rochell</hi> Monſieur <hi>Sabueſa,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Beecher,</hi> who ſtayed there till Saturday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Monſieur Saint <hi>Blancart</hi> diſſwaded the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to forbeare the Landing of his men vntill the next morning: but the Lord Generall fearing it would giue time to the Enemie to ſtrengthen himſelfe. Hee would by no meanes heare of any delay. Whereupon Monſieur Saint <hi>Blancart</hi> like a braue man, chooſed himſelfe a Pike, and put himſelfe into Sir <hi>John Burrowes</hi> Regiment.</p>
                  <p>By this time it was three of the clocke when the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall commanded to land two Regiments, that were of the olde Companies, whereof Sir <hi>Iohn Burrowes</hi> and Sir <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Brett</hi> were Commanders, he went with them himſelfe on ſhore, and appointed the two Colonels in what place they ſhould land their men. And being landed, commanded them to put their men in Battalia with all ſpeed, fearing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vvould giue them a ſuddaine aſſault.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1924:13"/>
                  <p>The men being vveary in lying on Shipboard, lingred vvaſhing their hands in the Sea; but the Lord Generall vvith a Cudgell runne to and fro amongſt them, beating ſome, and threatning other-ſome, and got them thruſt vp three Pykes length to the skirt of the banke, vvhere they vvere to be.</p>
                  <p>There vvas a third Regiment that vvas ready to land: in the meane time came Sir <hi>William Courtney</hi> to the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and tolde him, that vnleſſe hee ſhould doe the ſame curteſie for him vvhich he did for the other two Collonells, hee ſhould not get his men landed, and that his vvere olde Souldiers, and vvould doe good ſeruice if the Enemie made aſſault.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon my Lord called Sir <hi>William Courtney,</hi> &amp; vvent into his Barge, vvith an intention to haſten a ſhore his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and as ſoone as he had gone about foureſcore from the ſhore, hee preſently heard the fight begun, and turning backe, he ſaw three Troupes of French Horſe, charging our Foote vvith all the fierceneſſe that might be: And the third Regiment, thoſe that vvere vnlanded, preſsing themſelues amongſt the Shippes to ſuccour themſelues: the reſt of that Regiment that vvere landed hee ſawe preſt into the vvater by the French Horſe; and Sir <hi>William Haydon</hi> being caried violently to the Sea by the Reuolters, was there drowned.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon he ſet S. <hi>William Courtney</hi> into another Boate, with commande to make all expedition to get his Men lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; And very brauely himſelfe drew his Sword, and turned his Barge (attended by Maſter <hi>Grymes</hi> and M. <hi>Aſhburneham</hi>) and thruſt himſelfe vpon the Reuolters; and rebuking ſome, and encouraging others, told them, he hoped they came not with any intent but to aduenture themſelues ſo farre as he would leade them: Wherevpon, he thruſt himſelfe on to the ſhoare, (and they followed ſlowly) and animating of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foote which were run into the water they moſt of them leapt out of the water, and vpon the Lord Generalls words threw themſelues forwards as if they would haue fought brauely, but before we could get where the blowes were, the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1924:13"/> Battaile was ended.</p>
                  <p>My Lord Generall had ordered certaine Shippes to ſcoure the Landing place with their Ordnance, but the aſſault was ſo ſodaine as they did little hurt to the Enemie; and in verie heate of the combate, it fell out, that one of our owne Shipps had entangled himſelfe betweene our Battering ſhippes and the Land, by which meanes they were hindred in performing of their charge.</p>
                  <p>If the French Foote had come on to haue charged preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon the diſcharge of the Horſe, it had been impoſſible that we could haue withſtood them; But as God would haue it, the Horſe-men made more haſt then in iudgement they ſhould haue don: Before the Foote came we had killed moſt of their Horſes; But when the Foote did come, they came very orderly and brauely, being 1500. comming within a Pike and a halfe of our Men before they diſcharged; and the Leader of the Foote (being a braue and goodlie Gentleman) tooke off his hatte, wherevpon all their Foote diſcharged their Muskets, and after they fell to it with Swords and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>h of Pike, vntill they were breathleſſe on both ſides: The French finding our Pikes to be longer than theirs threw away their Pikes, and went to it with Stones, and ſo did our Men, but ours beate them out, and made them flye away very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, that happie was he that got firſt off his Armor to betake him to his heeles.</p>
                  <p>This Battaile did not continue in all much aboue halfe an hower, but our Horſe were not yet landed; But if we had had twentie Horſe to haue followed them, we had killed them vp euery Man. That night we intrenched our ſelues in that place, fearing the Enemie would giue vs an aſſault in the night. My Lord Generall ſpent that euening in viewing of the dead Bodies, and viſiting thoſe that were hurt on our ſide, and giuing great charge to the Chirurgions to take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care of them.</p>
                  <p>We tooke fower of the French Gentlemen, but they were all hurt before; two of them dyed the next day, one of them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1924:14"/> is aliue yet in the <hi>Tryumph,</hi> his thigh being ſhotte to peeces, the other, being a Page, the Lord Generall ſent him to his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The next morning very earlie, the Lord Generall came on ſhore againe, and ſpent all the whole daie there, calling the Commanders to him, and ordering them to bring him notes of euery ſeuerall Companie, how many they were, and how manie were periſhed in the conflict; By which vve found, there was nineteene Captaines, Antients and Lieuetenants killed, and twelue other Officers hurt, but in no danger of death, and ſome thirty fiue common Soldiers drowned, but none killed; for the French men diſcharged all on our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and neuer looked at the Common ſort. Our Gentry (when the common Soldiers began to route) clapt themſelues together, and ſhewed themſelues the braueſt Men in the world, eſpetially Sir <hi>Iohn Burrowes,</hi> Sir <hi>Alexander Brett,</hi> Sir <hi>George Blundell,</hi> and a Brother of Sir <hi>Alexander Bretts:</hi> There was not one Gentleman of our Nation in the field that did not act his part brauely.</p>
                  <p>This being Friday, the day after the Battaile, the 13. of Iuly, Monſieur <hi>de Thorax,</hi> Gouernour of the Iſland, ſent the Barron <hi>Ambleuile</hi> with a Trumpet to ſpeake wth the Lord Generall: His Meſſage was, to deſire my Lords fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to giue them leaue to fetch away their dead bodies: they being ſo ſuddenly demaunded by them, my Lord made ſcruple in granting it. Whereupon the Gentry made meanes by ſome of our Officers to buy the bodies, and offered for one 1000. pounds. When my Lord Generall had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he gaue leaue that they ſhould take them away.</p>
                  <p>Within foure houres the Gouernours ſent another Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, with one of his Pages, to giue him thankes for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and to report to him that he would neuer after harbour an ill thought of the Engliſh, for hee iudged the Gentry of them to be the braueſt men in the world. Although before the Battaile he made no more account of vs then if wee had beene all Beeues: and enquiring what number we were, wee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1924:14"/> tolde him 6000. He ſaid he would kill vs and ſalt vs, as wee did Oxen in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ſame time he ſent my Lord Generall word, that he would wayte on him himſelfe, ſo that we made full account that hee would giue vs Battell. The ſame day wee put our ſelues in Battalia, and expected them all that day, yet hee came not. The next day being the 14. of Iuly, we made our ſelues ready to Martch, and at 6. of the clocke we marched an Engliſh mile further into the Countrey, leauing Sir <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine Bartue</hi> in the place with ſome Companies.</p>
                  <p>The 15. by 6. of the clocke in the morning, vve marched on to a Village vvithin an Engliſh mile, and tooke in that vvithout any diſturbance. Then vve marched on two Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh miles further, to a Towne called St. <hi>Maries,</hi> vvhen vvee came neere to the Towne, the Proteſtants came out and yeelded the Towne to the Lord Generall, ſo hee went with ſome Gentlemen with him, and tooke poſſeſsion, and made the Souldiers martch by, and not ſuffer them to come to the Towne, fearing they vvould pillage and diſturbe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo vve marched on the ſame day, to a Towne called <hi>La Flote.</hi> In the mid vvay the Enemie appeared vvith 120. horſe and 1500. Foote, the which were left vnkilled. Wee did verily thinke they would haue giuen vs Battell, but it did not proue ſo: for as ſoone as they viewed vs, they returned backe againe.</p>
                  <p>We vvere ready for them, for our men vvere very forward to fight, ſo vve marched on vvithin halfe a mile of <hi>La Flote,</hi> vvhere the Proteſtants of that Towne met vs, and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Towne and themſelues vvith a ſuite they had to the Lord Generall, vvhich vvas that hee vvould for their ſakes ſhew fauour to the Romiſh Catholiques: for that they had liued long together in that Towne, and euer receiued good Quarter and vſage from them: And that now ſeeing he vvas become Maſter of both, he vvould requite it on their behalfe to the Catholiques, vvhich hee very Nobly conſented vnto, and vvent vvith them to the Towne, and tooke poſſeſsion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1924:15"/> and preſently turned backe to the Souldiers, and Encamped them round about the ſame, and vvould not ſuffer any of them to goe into it, fearing they vvould make Pillage, and that night lay amongſt them in the open Field, vvith no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bedding, ſaue one Cloake vnder his head, and another vpon him.</p>
                  <p>The next day being the 16 he went into the Towne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Monſieur <hi>Subeſa,</hi> and ſome other Lords, to bury Sir <hi>William Heydon,</hi> and returned into the Field at night, and lay as he did before. But that night about two of the clocke, there fell very miſerable vveather, vvith Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and Rayning, and continued ſo till twelue of the clock the next day.</p>
                  <p>The next day, being the 17. vve martched on towards St. <hi>Martyns,</hi> though it Rayned very fearefully: and about 12. of the clocke it grew faire; at which time vve vvere vvithin three Engliſh miles of the Towne.</p>
                  <p>By that time we had marched a mile further, we could ſee the Enemie ſally out of the Fort vvith Horſe and Foote: ſo they Martched towards vs, and vvere vvithin the diſtance of an Engliſh mile: and wee thought they vvould take the aduantage of our weary Martching, and giue vs Battell.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it was holden fit by the Lord Generall, that we ſhould take all aduantage we could in that place, which was onely to gaine the Sunne and the Winde of them. We mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on toward the end of the Towne, that lay next vnto the Sea ſide, and furtheſt from the Fort. And by that wee had aduantage both of Sunne and Winde. Within leſſe then an Engliſh mile of the end of the Towne, we could ſee the Horſe approach very fiercely, as though they would come ſuddenly vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Lord Generall gaue order to the Maſter of the Ordnance, to ſhoote ſome of our Drakes at them; which he did, and killed a Gentleman and two Horſes, and put all the reſt in feare and diſorder.</p>
                  <p>Here Captaine <hi>Coningham</hi> (Lieutenant of the Horſe) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1924:15"/> himſelfe on horſebacke, and proffered a ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but no Man anſwered him. Whereupon they preſently put out a Flagge of Truce, and ſent ſome of the Proteſtantes to vs to render the Towne, without any condition; So that we preſently marched into it in Battalia, and quartered all our Soldiers therein. The Lord Generall rode to euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and deſired them to be carefull of themſelues and not to wrong the Towne, and that they ſhould take nothing but what was giuen them and what they payde for, and that he would goe aboard the victualing Shippes, and told them they ſhould want nothing, which contented them verie well, and thanked God with a loude voyce that they had ſuch a worthy Lord Generall.</p>
                  <p>He tooke his Barge, and accordingly went, and as he was going, there was a poore Engliſhman in diſtreſſe in a Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, where the Tyde had locked him about, and had no meanes to ſaue himſelfe, but muſt runne towards the Fort, where the Enemie was retired with all his Forces: My Lord hearing him ſo cry out, cauſed to ſtay his Barge (although the Barge-men told him he would endanger the caſting away of himſelfe; and the Gentlemen perſwaded him alſo, that he ſhould not hazard himſelfe in the danger, yet would he not ſtirre before he had releeued this Man and got him into his Barge; So after went aboard of the Victualing Shippes, and ſaw all the proportions of the Victuals ſent to the Soldiers; and after went aboard the <hi>Tryumph.</hi> And on wedneſday the 16. made a diſpatch for <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint the King with his fortunate proceedings.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy was retired into the Fort a Musket ſhot, with 1500. Men, of which number, there was 120. Horſe left; they had neyther Water nor Wood in their Fort, and had but ſome eight or nine Peeces of Ordnance, and the Fort too little for ſo great a Company, ſo that it was not likely that they could hold it long, and we hope to be Maſters of it, as well as of the Iſland, within a very ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>Thurſeday and Fryday, we were rayſing a Mount to plant
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1924:16"/> our Ordnance againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Saterday the 21. we planted twentie one peeces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and eleuen Drakes, and the Maſter Gunner was very confident to batter them from the Fort in a very ſhort time: We were working with our Pyoniers, and our Soldiers tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching againſt the Fort.</p>
                  <p>This is all I was an Eye witneſſe to. So God ſend them good ſucceſſe, and I for <hi>England,</hi> in his Maieſties Good Ship, called the <hi>Charles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was ſlayne that day in (the Battaile) of the <hi>French</hi> 125. Horſemen, dead on the ground, beſides a great many that were deadly hurt, of vvhich number, there vvere 23. Marqueſſes and Barons; all the reſt Knightes and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of the beſt quallitie in all <hi>France:</hi> Some Commanders of their Foote vvere killed, with 100. or 120.

                  <p>THe Cittadell in the Iſle St. <hi>Martins,</hi> holds out ſtill, the Walls and Fortifications thereof being made ſo ſtrong and ſubſtantiall, that our Cannon that beate on it perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally could doe little hurt to it, in ſo much as my Lord wrought by Mynes, and hath cut off two Pipes that carried vvater to the ſame, but findes that part of the ground which is penetrable neere the Cittadell, to be looſe ſandy ground, which will not Mine, and the foundation of the Cittadell, and the part neere the ſame is Rocky, not to be wrought: ſo as my Lord hauing beaten the Enemie out of his out-workes into the Fort, is reſolued to endeuour to recouer the ſame by famine, there being 3000. men in the Caſtle, and they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Firing and Water. My Lord hath planted aboue 20. Peeces of Ordnance by Sea and Land againſt the Cittadell: and the third ſhot that the Kings Cananere made, killed 41. French men, as ſome who were then in the Fort related.</p>
                  <p>My Lord lately intercepted two ſmall Veſſels laden vvith Victuals, and one laden vvith Munition, vvhich vvere in the night, paſsing from the mayne ouer the Riuer to releeue the Cittadell, that vvhich vvas laden vvith Munition, vvas in the taking ſunke vvith a Shot, and 37.

                  <p>My Lord walkes the round moſt nights, to ſee the Watch performe their Duty: And Sunday laſt vvas ſeauen dayes lay in our Trenches all night, vpon aduertiſements, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie vvould ſally, and aſſault the men in our Workes.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Montioy</hi> (chiefe Commaunder of the Horſe) very happily ſurprized 28. of the beſt of the Enemies Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katieres, vvho vvere ſent out of the Fort for a guard to ſome vvho vvere ſent to fetch vvater at a Well, not farre diſtant
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1924:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> from the Fort: as ſoone as they perceiued our Horſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, they ranne into a Mill, and there (vpon quarter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded and graunted) they yeelded.</p>
                  <p>My Lord hath by Proclamation giuen permiſsion to the Inhabitants of the Ile to make Salt, with which Commodity his Grace intendeth to ſatisfie the Dutch men (who were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp to tranſport Horſes and Prouiſions for the Armie) for the hire of their Ships, and likewiſe to furniſh <hi>England</hi> with Salt.</p>
                  <p>The Gouernour of the Cittadell and Ile of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> ſendeth euery day ſome Meſſenger to ſpeake with my Lord: And about tenne dayes ſince vnder colour of a Parly, ſent a Diſciple of the Ieſuites to haue miſchieued his Grace: the Villaine being come to act his Villanie, when hee began to ſpeake to my Lord, changed his colour, and ſo trembled, that he could ſcarce ſpeake: whereupon his Grace commaunded one that was with him, to ſearch him, &amp; there was found in the Sleeue of his Doublet, a long <hi>Rauilliack</hi>-like Knife poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, which at the firſt he ſaid he caried for his defence: but that being no place to carrie a Weapon for defence, he was that night committed, and being threatned to be tortured, hee deſired to be brought before the Lord Generall, which was graunted; and then he confeſſed that the Gouernour had diſsiplined, and hired him to murther my Lord: and being queſtioned how he durſt vndertake ſuch a miſchieuous work, ſince he could not hope to eſcape death, or enioy the reward he was to haue: he ſaid he did beleeue it would coſt him his life; but being perſwaded, it was a meritorious worke, and promiſed, his Wife and Children for it ſhould be aduanced, he vndertooke the ſame; and falling downe at my Lords feet, beſought his pardon. My Lord ſent him backe to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and after three dayes pardoned him, and ſent him ouer into the mayne.</p>
                  <p>All Souldiers cry out againſt the Gouernour for this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and ſay, hee deſerues not to haue any Quarter, that would offer the ſame to one who hath in all poynts caried
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1924:17"/> himſelfe ſo Nobly towards him, and all the French that haue beene at his mercy, for my Lord ſent him back his Brothers Page, which was taken in the day of Battell; and hauing found the Gouernours brothers Gentleman of his Horſe wounded in the Field, cauſed him to bee ſent a board his owne Ship, and looked vnto by his owne Chirurgion.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>George Blundell</hi> is lately dead of the wounds hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly receiued in the day of Battell.</p>
